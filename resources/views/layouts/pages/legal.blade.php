We take reasonable precautions — including technical, administrative and physical measures — to safeguard your information. We use technical safeguards such as ﬁrewalls and data encryption. Your account information including email address is located on a secured server behind a ﬁrewall. We authorize access to personally identiﬁable information, including email addresses, only for those employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by conﬁdentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. We also enforce physical access controls to our buildings and ﬁles.
